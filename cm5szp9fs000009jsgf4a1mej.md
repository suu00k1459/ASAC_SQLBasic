### Hello,

This posting is for reviewing python class and practicing making website.

At lest, in my experience, trying to make a web site is good for understanding when we analysis the data. Because we can understand how the data to stack on the DB and how the developer to work, so maybe we can have a good conversation in the meeting of office.

So, today, I‚Äôll practice to make a small web site. Of course, I‚Äôm not a developer, I can‚Äôt make very good quality site but it is good for toy project.

### What I want to make the website

I want to experience many things, so I‚Äôll suppose to make a website of company. And I‚Äôll assume to upload my drawing sticker products.

# Look around HTML

Fist of all, I don‚Äôt know the HTML and CSS for website, so I‚Äôll look around the HTML templets of free design. You can find many designs of it in the internet.

I used the theme ‚Äú[astral](https://html5up.net/astral)‚Äù in this site.

If you download the file then you can see like this.

Maybe Web Developer made folder html file, js folder, css folder, and images folder depends on the developers.

First of all, I‚Äôll open the file of index.html. I open it by two way using web and vs code.

If you open it on web then you can see the design directly. So after I will change something on the code and check the change something in web.

Let‚Äôs start to change it easily.

### change the parts

1. Name : Jane Doe ‚Üí Vintage Sticker Shop
    
2. Picture : gradation ‚Üí My drawing picture
    
3. Logo : Twitter ‚Üí Instargram
    
4. Under : Add My blog
    

## 1 . Name

After earch the letter ‚ÄúJane Doe‚Äù and I change it.

```haml
<header>
    <h1>Vintage Sticker</h1>
    <p>Artist SU adds beauty to your records.</p>
</header>
```

I changed like this! Let‚Äôs check it!

## 2 . Picture

When you look this code, in the Home section, you can find the code ‚Äúimg src= ‚Äúimages/me.jpg‚Äù about image.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736646270352/4fa95df1-bd5b-4d55-b99e-da629a8080ea.png align="center")

So, I‚Äôll put my own image at images folder, and change the code little bit.

```http
<img src="images/pict1.jpg" alt="" />
```

I put my picture named ‚Äúpict1.jpg‚Äù in the images folder and change the code.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736646412215/a22bc728-e3fc-421d-ad27-081a55f263b3.png align="center")

The result! Interesting!

## 3 . Logo

When you look at this code, usually we can meet some picture, but in here used something different way. So I found what is the ‚Äúicon brands fa-twitter‚Äù

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736646886498/4515c9c2-fa35-4d71-ad0a-f86e57ffafe6.png align="center")

I can get an answer this [site](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/).

So I‚Äôll change it to Instargram icon and I link it to my SNS account.(If you wonder, you can come my account and follow :))

```http
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/swimming.space/" class="icon brands fa-instargram"><span>Twitter</span></a>
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736647253071/7718734a-e0bf-47ce-b7a3-fac6ff329799.png align="center")

Now it is changed it.

## 4 . Add my blog

Find this part, you can see the Untitled, Design ect‚Ä¶

Until now, we changed only letter but now we focus on the ‚Äú&lt;li&gt;‚Äù

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">üí°</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">&lt; li &gt; : list items</div>
</div>

  
So I add the code like this. (I want to use only my link but I left the existing code as is because I need a source.

```http
<li>&copy; Untitled.</li><li>Design: <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a></li><li>Artist SU <a href="https://swimmingspace.hashnode.dev/"> Blog</a></li>
```

Now the item is added and link is also working.

Today I changed main page, next time I‚Äôll make it another things.

1. HTML is consist of &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;
    
2. &lt;div&gt; is exist inside of &lt;body&gt;
    
3. &lt;div&gt; is like a block
    
4. When the block start then write &lt;body&gt;, and end of it, write &lt;/body&gt;
